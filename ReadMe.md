# NATS JetStream Kafka State Analysis Project

This project consists of multiple microservices that simulate a Kafka state monitoring and analysis system using NATS JetStream. The system includes a mock Kafka state generator, a publisher, an analyzer, and a result sender, all communicating through NATS JetStream.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (version 1.20 or higher)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nats_jetstream_project.git
   cd nats_jetstream_project
   ```

2. **Build the Docker images:**

   Each microservice has its own directory with a `Dockerfile`. Build the Docker images using the following commands:

   ```sh
   docker-compose build
   ```

## Running the Services

1. **Start the Docker containers:**

   Use Docker Compose to start all the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

   ```sh
   docker-compose up
   ```

   This command will start the following services:
   - NATS server with JetStream enabled
   - Mock Kafka state generator
   - Kafka state publisher
   - State analyzer
   - Result sender

2. **Verify that all services are running:**

   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8222` to access the NATS server monitoring interface. You should see the NATS server running with JetStream enabled.

## Usage

1. **Mock Kafka State Generator:**

   The mock service generates random Kafka states and exposes them via HTTP.

   - **GET /state:** Returns a random Kafka state.
   - **POST /result:** Accepts analysis results and logs them.

2. **Kafka State Publisher:**

   The publisher fetches states from the mock service and publishes them to the `kafka_state` topic in JetStream.

3. **State Analyzer:**

   The analyzer subscribes to the `kafka_state` topic, processes the states, and publishes the analysis results to the `analyzed_state` topic in JetStream.

4. **Result Sender:**

   The result sender subscribes to the `analyzed_state` topic and sends the analysis results back to the mock service.

## Example Commands

1. **Get a Kafka state:**

   ```sh
   curl http://localhost:8080/state
   ```

2. **Send analysis result:**

   ```sh
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":1,"status":"ok","message":"ok no changes needed"}' http://localhost:8080/result
   ```
